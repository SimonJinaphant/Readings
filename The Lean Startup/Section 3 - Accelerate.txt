Engine of growth - mechanism used to achieve sustainable growth, not including one-time events that generate surge of customers but have no long term impact

Sustainable growth rule: New customer come from the actions of past customers

4 factors which power the engine of growth
1. Word of mouth - Satisfied customer love for product
2. Side effect of product usage, Influence by society for fashion or status.
3. Funded Advertising - As long as cost of acquiring new customer  is less than revenue that customer generates, the excess can be used to acquire more customers
4. Repeat purchase or use - some product are designed to be purchased repeatedly through subscription or voluntary repurchase

When a product is on the market, invent energy in finding new customers, servicing existing customers, improving quality, or driving down cost; don't spend time arguing about prioritization of new development

Sticky Engine - Rely on high customer retention, track attrition and churn rate (fraction of customer in any period who fail to remain engage in product). If rate of new accusation exceeds churn rate, the product will grow

Viral Engine - Customers does most of the share of marketing, this is distinct from word of mouth growth, as product exhibit viral growth depending on person-to-person transmission as consequence of normal usage, customers are not intentionally acting as evangelist who try to spread the word.
