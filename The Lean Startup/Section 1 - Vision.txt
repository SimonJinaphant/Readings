=======================
VISION
=======================
Startups involve management, which seem odd since both words appear as opposites. Many take the "just do it" attitude, avoiding all forms of management, process, and discipline. but this leads to more chaos than success. Entrepreneurship require managerial discipline to harness opportunities given

Ask people to start measuring their productivity differently, the goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build -what customers want and will pay for- as quickly as possible. Its a new way of looking at the development of innovative new products that emphasize fast iteration and customer insight, a vision, and an ambition, all the the same time.

Instead of making complex plans based with a lot of assumptions, make constant adjustments with a steering wheel (the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop) We can learn when and if its time to make a sharp turn (a pivot) or whether we should persevere along the current path.

*product,strategy, vision picture*

Product changes constantly through optimization (tuning the engine)
Strategy changes less frequently through pivoting
Vision rarely changes


DEFINE
=========================
Entrepreneurs - referring to entire startup ecosystem regardless of company size, sector, or stage of development. From young visionaries with little backing but great ideas to seasoned visionaries within large companies

A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty. Although this statement omits context about the size of the company, industry, or sector of the economy

Startups are not just about a product, tech breakthrough, or brilliant ideas, it is a greater sum of its parts

Developing experimental system is the responsibility of senior management; its moving leaders from playing Caesar with their thumbs up and down on every idea into putting the culture and system so the team can move and innovate at the speed of experimental system


LEARN
=================
We must learn what customers really want, not what they say they want or what we think they should want. Validated learning is not after-the-fact rationalization or a story designed to hide failure, it is a method for demonstrating progress when faced with extreme uncertainty. The process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truth about a present and future business prospect.

Lean thinking defines value as providing benefits to the customers; everything else is a waste. In manufacturing, customers don't care how the product was assembled, only that it works correctly.

Find a synthesis between our vision and what customers would accept; not to capitulate to what customers thought they wanted or to tell customers what they should want

IMVU originally as a 3D Avatar site with an IM add-on. But customers (through experiments) wanted the use it to make friends online without compromising real-life identity, whereas other social products were centered on customers real life identity.

The question is not can this product be built, but rather Should this product be built and can we sustain a business around this set of product/services
We need a method for breaking down a business plan into components and testing each part empirically

EXPERIMENT
===================
"Just do it" -> Lets just ship a product and see what happens

A true experiment follows the scientific method, begins with a clear hypothesis that predicts what is suppose to happen, then test those empirically

If rely on existing market research or survey, you're asking what customers thought they wanted. Instead, build a simple product and test

Break does the grand vision  into parts, two important assumptions make are value hypothesis and growth hypothesis
Value hypothesis test weather a product/service truly deliver value to customer once they are using it.
  We could survey them as indicator but people have hard time assessing their feelings objectively.

Growth hypothesis - test how new customer will discover a product/service.

Build a minimal viable product and experiment before building a large product based on assumptions

Entrepreneurs must overcome the management think which puts faith in well-researched plans, planning only works in the presence of a long and stable operating history.
